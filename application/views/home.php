At that time admission process was very simple and there was no extra donation given for admission and still a date there is an affordable fees structure.
                  From Nursery to std.-8 all teachers’ behavior is good and teaching method is also good. Teachers try different method and use smart class for easy study. There are many other extra activities like cultural program and sports activity arrange regularly. School also arrange picnic for fun and visit different places for knowledge.
