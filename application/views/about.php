			  <p class="flow-text">SKUM is like a rainbow, whichever angle you look at
				it, there is a different advantage: the courage the
				child develops from the school, the light thrown by
				the school on the spiritual soul, the encouragement
				the child gets to be successful, the creative side the
				child develops in this school, and the progress in
				overall development for the generation of today.
